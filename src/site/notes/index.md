 great success and acclaim (称赞) in her professional field. She was also 2)

 and sexy, though she seemed not to realize this either, so I told her these things too. But while I thought it was more important to praise her brilliance, it seemed to mean more to her that she was 3)

 attractive.

My experience with this girlfriend exemplifies a common phenomenon in life – when it comes to complimenting a woman, men often walk a very difficult line. Of course, 4)

 matters. In a professional setting, talking about appearance is often inappropriate, but at a singles club, it may be important. She will be very pleased if a man thinks her clothes and 5)

 for their intelligence and creativity. But at the same time, they want to be admired for their looks as well, for example, their perfect skin 7)

 and elegant outfits.

Unfortunately, most guys don't understand this. If we receive compliments from women, they're usually about our achievements, not our looks. Most of us don't expect a woman to tell us how 8)

 or sexy we are, and some of us would find it hard to regard such a(n) 9)

 as sincere.

I'm not saying it's very hard to be a guy these days. It is important for every man to understand how to treat women with both respect and 10)

. But as far as the right balance of these two is concerned, we really have no frame of reference, especially when it comes to looks.
